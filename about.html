          Akil Wijeratne is a senior at Newbury Park High School hoping to major in either Cognitive Science or Computer Science at either a UC school or large research school. He has been working as a Computer Science Intern at SAAZ Micro Technologies and Kratos Energy Solutions and frequently consults local businesses that are in need of evolving into the digitized world we live in today. Akil wanted to start College Clout because he wanted to promote the often ignored part of the college admissions process- extracurricular activities. Test scores and GPA are vital but the differentiating factor between many candidates are the activities they have done outside the classroom. With College Clout his mission is to assist future applicants with this vital part of the admissions process.
