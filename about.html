College Clout offers a quick way to find ways to stand out by helping students find internships, research programs, or job shadows, thus allowing students to bolster their college applications.

        <p class="tristan-description">
          Tristan Ferdinand is a senior at Westlake High School hoping to major in either cognitive science or computer science at a research institution. He has been working as a computer science intern at Vitu and holds leadership positions in multiple school clubs. Tristan wanted to start College Clout because he understands the stress that comes with the college admissions process and knows that it is difficult to take it on alone—especially for first generation college students. With his experiences and knowledge of the college application process, he hopes to serve those who choose to use College Clout as a guide on their college journeys!

        <p class="akil-description">
          Akil Wijeratne is a senior at Newbury Park High School hoping to major in either cognitive science or computer science at either a UC school or large research school. He has been working as a computer science intern at SAAZ Micro Technologies and Kratos Energy Solutions, and he frequently consults local businesses that need help evolving into the digitized world we live in today. Akil wanted to start College Clout because he wanted to promote the often ignored part of the college admissions process—extracurricular activities. Test scores and GPA are vital, but the differentiating factor between many candidates are the meaningful activities they have done outside the classroom. With College Clout, his mission is to assist future applicants with this important part of the admissions process.
